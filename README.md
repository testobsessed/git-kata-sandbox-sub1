git-kata-sandbox-sub1
=====================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/testobsessed/git-kata-sandbox-sub1.png)](https://travis-ci.org/testobsessed/git-kata-sandbox-sub1)

A repo to be remoted into git-kata-sandbox so I can practice bumping submodule pointers.
Also so that I can see what happens with Travis and ProjectMonitor on various flavors of bad builds and branches, forks, and pull requests.
